# Self Organizing Maps (SOM): Example using RNAseq reads

*Written by: Ciera Martinez*

Tutorial is for learning about how to run clustering analysis using Self Organizing Maps using the kohonen package in R.

[part 1](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part1_clean.html): Cleaning EdgeR output for SOM analysis.

[part 2a](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part2a_SOM.html): Running PCA and SOM

[part 2b](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part2b_superSOM.html): Running superSOM 

[part 3b](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part3b_visualizeSSOM.html): Further visualization to understand results

Running Code
-------------

To run examples, please download all files from [Github Repository page](https://github.com/iamciera/SOMexample) and keep files in the same folders they were downloaded in. Open .Rmd files in Rstudio and set working directory to directory in which code was opened in `.r`. (Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location)

**New to Github?**: There is a green button that says "clone or download", there is a "download" zip file option here.

Directory Structure of Repository
---------------------

data: Data need to run tutorials. Including output, input, and required data for further analysis after running SOMs.

pdf: Knitted output PDFs from the .Rmd files.

html: knitted output html from .Rmd files.

r: Rmd R markdown files with all original code. Please set working directory to this directory to run all code.
